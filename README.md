[Visit the Deployed Site](https://lth1013.github.io/workday-planner/)

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

This website enables you to create a calendar of events for your 9-5 workday. It has different colors depending on the time, and you can save events. It also displays the current day.

## Usage 

To use this website, enter in the tasks you need to do for your workday. Then, click the button to the side of each bar to save. Then on reload, they will still be there.
